1) contract access control will be by role(mechanism with a separate role for each privileged action. A role can have many authorized accounts if contract controled by role how many admins will have contract)  
or ownable(single account authorized for all privileged actions) mechanism ?
2) total nft's count and how many tokens will be reservd (whitelist,Javi) and price of them
3) nft owner accounts logic has any limits or privilegions (*example total supply of account lower then 3), and airdrop logic (in article was written about free token)
4) can multiply accounts have an nft token (fractional NFT)
5) will contract have burnible and paueble functions  
6) will be nfts stored in opensea?
7) who's gona do mint tokens (we or user in our website)
8) nft's rank(property) logic(and what is will be proportonal for example there are 10 nft the one is the super_rare, the two piece arerare and the others are standart...)  what proportonal should we divide them ?
9) nft's secendary royality logic in contract (* and procent of royality)
10) what is NFT Ring(i saw it in article)
